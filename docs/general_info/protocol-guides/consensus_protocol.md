# Consensus Protocol #

## Overview ##

An EOS Network Foundation blockchain is a distributed state machine that can operate in a decentralized fashion. The blockchain uses cryptographic signatures to ensure blocks linked in a successive chain. These cryptographic signatures make it impossible to modify previously completed transactions.

## Consensus Mechanism ##

The consensus mechanism is delegated proof of stake. EOS token holders can vote for [block producers](/general_info/glossary.md#Block Producers). These *block producers* are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks on the blockchain.
